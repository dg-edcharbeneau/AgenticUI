# Findings

## Tested stack

The sample currently uses:

- .NET 11 RC1 and Aspire 13.5.3
- `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI` and `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows` 1.15.0
- `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore` 1.15.0-preview.260722.1
- `AGUI.Client` and `AGUI.Server` 1.0.0
- `Azure.AI.OpenAI` 2.9.0-beta.1
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.AI` 0.1.0-preview.1.26459.102

The Components AI preview declares a dependency on a newer `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web` package. The web project pins that transitive dependency to the .NET 11 RC1 version available on NuGet.org and uses the ASP.NET Core shared framework at build and run time, avoiding custom package feeds.

## Validated capabilities

`AddAGUIServer()` and `MapAGUIServer()` expose Microsoft Agent Framework agents as AG-UI HTTP/SSE endpoints, while `AGUIChatClient` presents those endpoints to the Blazor app as standard `IChatClient` instances.

The scenarios validate:

- Streaming, multi-turn chat rendered as structured rich text
- Server tools mapped to generated typed blocks and custom renderers
- Automatically invoked frontend tools rendered with generated typed blocks
- Interactive UI actions that wait for explicit user confirmation
- Approve/reject interrupts
- Bidirectional editable state through AG-UI state snapshots
- Live plans through state snapshots and JSON Patch state deltas
- Predictive state with diff preview, acceptance, rejection, and rollback
- Reasoning summaries rendered through a custom activity block

## Integration findings

### Automatic tools and interactive UI actions use separate paths

`AGUIChatClient` 1.0.0 includes a `FunctionInvokingChatClient` and automatically invokes executable frontend tools supplied through `ChatOptions.Tools`. Their calls and results are ordinary tool content, so the Blazor AI components can map them to `FunctionInvocationContentBlock` instances or generated typed blocks.

The [frontend tools](../src/AgenticUI.Web/Components/Pages/Scenarios/FrontendTools.razor) scenario uses this automatic path for `set_accent_color` and renders the call and result with `AccentColorToolBlock`.

Registering a function with `RegisterUIAction` instead creates a `UIActionBlock` and pauses the interaction until application UI calls `InvokeAsync()`. Use this path when the UI or user must provide input before the agent can continue. The [predictive state](../src/AgenticUI.Web/Components/Pages/Scenarios/PredictiveState.razor) scenario presents an accept/reject dialog and adds the user's decision to the pending action arguments before invoking it.

### State transport, model context, and UI projection are separate concerns

`UIAgent<TState>` does not automatically send its current state as `RunAgentInput.State`. `AGUIChatClient` can forward state supplied through `ChatOptions.RawRepresentationFactory`, so applications that need bidirectional editable state must explicitly add that outbound mapping. Local edits remain client-side until the next agent request.

Receiving `RunAgentInput.State` also does not automatically add it to the model context. The shared-state and predictive-state agents use `TryGetRunAgentInput` and insert the current state immediately before the latest user request. Placing it before older tool results can allow stale conversation content to override the user's local edits.

Inbound state projection is also explicit. The shared-state scenario deserializes `StateSnapshotEvent` into its typed state, while the plan scenario applies the specific `StateDeltaEvent` replace operations emitted by `update_plan_step`.

### Predictive state requires explicit mapping and resolution

Registering `propose_document` as a frontend action does not make its argument predictive state. The predictive-state scenario maps the completed action's `document` argument with `SetPredictiveState`, then resolves that pending state with `AcceptPredictiveState` or `RejectPredictiveState` after the user reviews the diff.

With `AGUI.Client` 1.0.0, the completed action arguments are deserialized into `IDictionary<string, object?>`; a JSON string argument arrives at the state mapper as a string-valued `JsonElement`. The scenario validates that representation rather than supporting an unobserved CLR `string` alternative.

`AgentContext` rejects pending predictive state before publishing `Idle` or `Error`, so application code does not need a second completion-time rollback. Application-level validation is still useful before accepting or rejecting because the state APIs otherwise silently do nothing when no prediction is pending.

`AGUI.Server` 1.0.0 can expose provider-native argument fragments as incremental `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` events through `MapStreamingToolCallArguments`, but `AGUI.Client` coalesces those fragments into a completed `FunctionCallContent` before the Blazor state mapper sees them. Mapping partial tool arguments directly into predictive state still requires application or provider integration ([ag-ui#2245](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues/2245)).

### Component lifetime is handled by `AgentBoundary`

When its `Agent` parameter changes, `AgentBoundary` disposes the previous `AgentContext`, creates a new one, and recreates its descendants through an internally keyed render region. An additional `@key` on `AgentBoundary` is unnecessary; reset behavior was verified both with and without it.

Presentation components do not need direct access to `AgentContext`. In the predictive-state scenario, the workspace owns status handling and message dispatch while the document editor and suggestion list communicate through parameters and callbacks.

### Activity semantics and rendering are application-defined

`ActivityHandler<TBlock>` is an extensibility point, not an AG-UI activity implementation. The application decides which incoming `AIContent` starts, updates, and completes an activity and how that activity is rendered. The packages do not currently include an AG-UI `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` / `ACTIVITY_DELTA` handler or a built-in JSON Patch activity mapper; the sample's [reasoning handler](../src/AgenticUI.Web/Components/Pages/Scenarios/ReasoningActivityBlock.cs) is application code.

MAF/AG-UI can explicitly forward public AG-UI `BaseEvent` values through a response update's raw representation, but it does not automatically translate MAF workflow lifecycle events into AG-UI activity snapshots or deltas. Workflow agents therefore stream their ordinary output unless the application adds that mapping. Automatic workflow event projection remains tracked in [microsoft/agent-framework#2494](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/issues/2494).

### Rich text requires a structured tree

`RichTextContent` renders a supplied `RichTextNode` tree, but the package does not include a Markdown parser that creates that tree from model text. Agentic Chat wraps its AG-UI client in [`FormattedChatClient`](../src/AgenticUI.Web/Formatting/FormattedChatClient.cs), which accumulates streaming Markdown and projects it through the sample's [`MarkdownRichTextParser`](../src/AgenticUI.Web/Formatting/MarkdownRichTextParser.cs).

A custom `ContentBlockHandler<RichContentBlock>` would be a cleaner place for this presentation mapping because it could consume the original `TextContent` without changing the updates retained by `UIAgent`. The current public API does not support that implementation, however: a handler can call `RichContentBlock.AppendText`, but the `Content` setter and `ReplaceContent` method needed to supply parsed nodes are internal. The built-in structured-text renderer is also part of `MessageList` and is not exposed as a standalone component for a custom block.

Consequently, `FormattedChatClient` inserts cumulative `RichTextContent` snapshots into the stream before `UIAgent` processes it. Those presentation snapshots can become part of the agent's internal history alongside the original text content instead of leaving history as compact provider text. The reasoning scenario avoids duplicating the renderer and displays its provider-generated reasoning summary as plain text.

[dotnet/aspnetcore#69266](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/69266) proposes allowing custom handlers to replace the structured content of `RichContentBlock`. [dotnet/aspnetcore#69265](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/69265) proposes a finalization callback so handlers can flush buffered transformations before their blocks become inactive. [dotnet/aspnetcore#68418](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/68418) separately tracks extensible rich-node rendering.

### Voice is layered around the chat pipeline, not inside it

The real-time voice chat scenario adds Deepgram speech without changing the AG-UI or MAF path: voice is only another way to call `AgentContext.SendMessageAsync` and another way to present the streamed reply. Its only server-side piece is a dedicated `/voice_chat` agent whose instructions ask for short, plain spoken replies without Markdown, and explain the `[interrupted by the user]` marker the web app adds to replies the user talked over. With a reasoning model the agent also requests `minimal` reasoning effort, since silent thinking time is dead air in a conversation: on gpt-5-mini it cut the time to the first token from roughly 2.3 to 4 seconds to about 1.3 seconds. Microsoft.Extensions.AI's `ReasoningEffort` has no minimal level, so the agent sets `ChatReasoningEffortLevel.Minimal` through `ChatOptions.RawRepresentationFactory`, and only for reasoning deployments, because models such as gpt-4o-mini reject `reasoning_effort` with HTTP 400. Because the app is Interactive Server, audio can't be processed in C# without streaming it over the SignalR circuit, so the browser owns both Deepgram WebSockets. The server only mints short-lived JWTs (`/api/deepgram/token`); browsers can't set an `Authorization` header on a WebSocket, so the token travels as the `bearer` subprotocol.

The speech tap must read the reply before `FormattedChatClient` runs. The chain is `FormattedChatClient(SpeechTapChatClient(AGUIChatClient))`, so the tap sees the raw `TextContent` deltas rather than the cumulative `RichTextContent` snapshots (which would otherwise be spoken repeatedly). The tap strips Markdown syntax and skips fenced code before sending sentences to text-to-speech.

`MessageInput.TrailingActions` replaces the default send button, so the voice controls go in `LeadingActions`. That requires hand-building the chat layout inside `AgentBoundary` instead of using `ChatPage`. `ChatPage` does expose `InputLeadingActions`, but a component there has no documented guarantee that it receives the cascaded `AgentContext`.

The voice UI follows the [Deepgram voice UI best practices](https://github.com/dg-edcharbeneau/voice-best-practices). The browser module is an explicit state machine (`idle`, `connecting`, `listening`, `thinking`, `speaking`, `error`) with a single `setState()`, and the component renders the C# mirror, `VoiceState`, as an always-visible status (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`); errors are `role="alert"`. The mic button opens and closes a whole session: microphone first (so the permission prompt doesn't hold idle sockets open), then one token for both sockets, one Flux TTS socket for the session, and on stop `CloseStream`, the mic tracks, the TTS `Close`, and both audio graphs are released. Replies are voiced only while a session is active. A `preflight()` check (secure context, `getUserMedia`, `AudioWorklet`) disables the mic with the reason, and capture errors such as `NotAllowedError` become plain-language messages.

Two practices needed a Blazor Server adaptation. The mic meter's level arrives about 100 times a second, so JavaScript writes it straight to a CSS custom property on the meter element once per animation frame; sending it to .NET would cost a SignalR round-trip per update. And Flux TTS closes a session after 60 seconds without a client message, expecting WebSocket pings that browsers can't send. Reconnecting would reset the voice's cross-turn context, so the browser keeps the socket alive by re-sending the current speed as a no-op `Configure` after 20 idle seconds (verified to hold a session open well past 60 seconds). An unexpected close, including Deepgram's one-hour cap, ends the session in `error`.

Text-to-speech uses Flux TTS on `/v2/speak`, which is turn-based. Each agent reply is one turn: sentences stream in as `Speak` messages, audio starts on its own about 300 ms after the first one, and `Flush` ends the turn when the reply ends. The server announces turns with `SpeechStarted` and closes them with `SpeechMetadata`, and turns start in the order they were opened, so the browser tags every turn with its reply and plays only the current reply's audio. The state returns to `listening` only once the reply is done, its turn is synthesized, and its audio has played. The server doesn't insert whitespace between `Speak` messages, so each sentence is sent with a trailing space. It also forwards Markdown verbatim (it strips only SSML-style markup), which is why the tap still cleans the text.

Barge-in uses Flux turn events. On `StartOfTurn` during `thinking` or `speaking`, the browser stops playback immediately, sends Flux TTS an `Interrupt` with the session-wide playback offset (Deepgram measures `playback_offset` from the start of the session's audio), and .NET cancels the agent run with `AgentContext.CancelAsync`. `Interrupt` works even after a turn's synthesis has finished, so a reply that is still playing locally can always be reconciled. `SpeechInterrupted` reports `text_spoken`, and `SpeechTapChatClient` uses it to keep the agent's history honest: later requests send the agent a copy of the history in which the interrupted reply is cut to what the user heard, marked `[interrupted by the user]`, while the UI keeps showing the full reply. `UIAgent` leaves a cancelled response out of the history it sends, so in that case the tap inserts the heard text as an assistant message after the request that prompted it. `EndOfTurn` commits are guarded by `turn_index`, so a turn superseded by a newer one is dropped, and transcripts are ignored while the conversation is `AwaitingInput`, so speech can't talk over a pending tool approval.

## Current limitations

The sample creates one stable AG-UI thread ID for each `UIAgent`; reset creates a new agent and thread. It has no application-level durable conversation store, so it does not demonstrate persistence across page instances, server restarts, or multiple server instances.

After a rejected predictive-state proposal, the model can sometimes issue another proposal despite being instructed to acknowledge the rejection and stop. State rollback works correctly, but reliably preventing the repeated tool call would require targeted tool suppression or a client-only completion path rather than prompt instructions alone.

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.AI` 0.1.0-preview.1 and `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore` 1.15.0-preview are preview packages. Their APIs and hosting behavior may change before stable releases.

Voice relies on the browser's echo cancellation to keep spoken replies from reaching the microphone. With speakers rather than headphones, residual echo can trigger a false barge-in that cuts a reply short.
