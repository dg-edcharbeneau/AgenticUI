# Building agentic UI with .NET

This sample demonstrates how to build rich agentic user experiences with .NET. A **Blazor** chat experience provides a flexible conversational foundation, and the scenarios extend it with structured rich text, tool-driven UI, human approval, shared and predictive state, generative UI, and visible reasoning. The backend hosts agents built with the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)**, while the **[AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com) C# SDK** carries messages, actions, and state between the agents and the preview [Blazor AI components](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-11#experimental-blazor-ai-components-for-agentic-user-interfaces). [Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/) wires the application together, and the agents use **[Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/)** for model inference.

## What it demonstrates

| Scenario | AG-UI feature | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agentic chat** | Streaming, multi-turn chat (`TEXT_MESSAGE_*`) rendered as structured rich text | `/agentic_chat` |
| **Backend tools** | Server-side tool calls (`TOOL_CALL_*`) mapped to a generated typed block and custom card | `/backend_tool_rendering` |
| **Frontend tools** | Application-local tool invoked through the AG-UI client tool pipeline and rendered as a typed block | `/tool_based_generative_ui` |
| **Human in the loop** | Tool approval interrupt → Approve / Reject → resume | `/human_in_the_loop` |
| **Shared state** | Bidirectional typed state via request state and `STATE_SNAPSHOT` | `/shared_state` |
| **Predictive state** | Proposed document edits with accept/reject and rollback | `/predictive_state` |
| **Agentic generative UI** | Live plan via `STATE_SNAPSHOT` + `STATE_DELTA` (JSON Patch) | `/agentic_generative_ui` |
| **Reasoning** | Reasoning summaries via `REASONING_*` events and a custom activity block | `/reasoning` |
| **Real-time voice chat** | Agentic chat driven by voice: [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) Flux speech-to-text in, Flux text-to-speech out, with barge-in | `/voice_chat` |

## Architecture

![Architecture of the AgenticUI sample from Blazor through AG-UI and ASP.NET Core to Microsoft Foundry](docs/images/blazor-agentic-ui-architecture.svg)

- **`AgenticUI.AgentServer`** — ASP.NET Core app. Uses `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore` (`AddAGUIServer()` + `MapAGUIServer("/route", agent)`) to expose one AG-UI endpoint per scenario. Agents are MAF `AIAgent`s backed by Microsoft Foundry via `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI`.
- **`AgenticUI.Web`** — Blazor Web App (Interactive Server). Each scenario builds a `UIAgent` over an `AGUIChatClient` (from the AG-UI C# SDK's `AGUI.Client`), which turns an AG-UI endpoint into a standard `IChatClient`. UI is rendered with the Blazor AI components (`ChatPage`, `MessageList`, `BlockRenderer`, `UIAgent<TState>`, …).
- **Voice** — the real-time voice chat scenario layers Deepgram around the unchanged AG-UI pipeline. The browser streams microphone audio straight to Deepgram Flux (`wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/listen`), and Flux's end-of-turn detection triggers `AgentContext.SendMessageAsync` with the transcript. A `SpeechTapChatClient` inside `FormattedChatClient` splits the streamed reply into sentences, and the browser streams them to Deepgram Flux TTS (`wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/speak`) as one turn per reply. Both sockets authenticate with short-lived JWTs from the web app's `/api/deepgram/token` endpoint, so the API key never reaches the browser and no audio crosses the Blazor circuit. The voice UI follows the [Deepgram voice UI best practices](https://github.com/dg-edcharbeneau/voice-best-practices): an explicit, always-visible state machine, a mic meter, barge-in that reports what the user actually heard back into the agent's history, and one TTS socket per voice session.
- **`AgenticUI.AppHost` / `AgenticUI.ServiceDefaults`** — Aspire orchestration and service discovery.

### Real-time voice

![Real-time voice architecture: the browser streams audio to Deepgram Flux speech-to-text and plays Flux TTS audio, the Blazor web app mints Deepgram tokens and talks to the agent server over AG-UI, and the agent server runs on Microsoft Foundry](docs/images/deepgram-voice-architecture.svg)

The browser owns both Deepgram WebSockets, so audio never crosses the Blazor circuit. The web app only mints short-lived tokens and moves text: the finished transcript goes to the `/voice_chat` agent over AG-UI, and the reply's sentences come back to the browser for Flux TTS.

### Packages used

- `Microsoft.Agents.AI`, `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI` (1.15.0)
- `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore` (1.15.0-preview — the AG-UI hosting glue is still preview)
- `AGUI.Client`, `AGUI.Abstractions`, `AGUI.Formatting`, `AGUI.Server` (1.0.0 — the stable AG-UI .NET SDK)
- `Azure.AI.OpenAI` (2.9.0-beta.1)
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.AI` (0.1.0-preview.1.26459.102)
- `Aspire` (13.5.3)

## Running it

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 11 RC1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/11.0)
- [Aspire CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- A **[Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) resource** with a
  `gpt-5.4-mini` deployment (used for both the general chat and reasoning scenarios).
- Optional: a [Deepgram API key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup) for the real-time voice chat scenario.

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danroth27/AgenticUI.git
cd AgenticUI
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Configure Microsoft Foundry

Sign in to Azure with the identity that has access to the Foundry resource:

```bash
az login
```

The identity must have the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on the Foundry resource. Ask the resource owner or administrator to assign the role if you don't have permission to do so.

Set the existing Foundry account endpoint as an AppHost user-secret:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:foundry-endpoint" "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/" --project src/AgenticUI.AppHost
```

Use the Foundry resource endpoint, such as `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/`. The AppHost models Foundry as an externally managed HTTPS dependency, so it won't provision or modify the Foundry account. The app authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID through `DefaultAzureCredential`; a deployed AgentServer's managed identity needs the same role as the local developer.

Both deployment names default to `gpt-5.4-mini`. Override them when your deployment names differ:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:foundry-model" "<deployment-name>" --project src/AgenticUI.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:foundry-reasoning-model" "<reasoning-deployment-name>" --project src/AgenticUI.AppHost
```

> **Why a separate reasoning path?** Reasoning models only return their reasoning summaries through
> the OpenAI **Responses** API — chat completions spend the same reasoning tokens but return no
> reasoning text. So the reasoning scenario builds its client with `GetResponsesClient()` and opts in
> via the provider-neutral `ChatOptions.Reasoning`
> (`new ReasoningOptions { Output = ReasoningOutput.Full }`). `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` maps that to
> the Responses API's reasoning summary setting and surfaces the summaries as `TextReasoningContent`,
> which the MAF AG-UI adapter emits as `REASONING_*` events.

### Configure Deepgram (optional)

The real-time voice chat scenario needs a Deepgram API key. It stays on the server; the web app exchanges it
for 30-second JWTs that the browser uses to open its Deepgram WebSockets.

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:deepgram-api-key" "<deepgram-api-key>" --project src/AgenticUI.AppHost
```

A `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` environment variable works too. Without a key the app runs normally and the
voice controls stay hidden.

### Run

```bash
aspire run
```

Open the Aspire dashboard, then open the **web** resource and pick a scenario from the nav.

### Troubleshooting

- **No Microsoft Foundry endpoint configured:** Set the `Parameters:foundry-endpoint` AppHost user-secret shown above.
- **Authentication failures:** Run `az login` again and verify that the selected identity has the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role.
- **Microphone button disabled on Real-time voice chat:** Hover it for the reason. Voice needs a secure context (the `https` endpoint, or `localhost`) and a browser with `getUserMedia` and `AudioWorklet`.
- **No microphone button on Real-time voice chat:** Set `Parameters:deepgram-api-key` and restart the AppHost. The browser also needs microphone permission and a secure context (the `https` endpoint, or `localhost`).
- **Model deployment not found:** Set `Parameters:foundry-model` and `Parameters:foundry-reasoning-model` to the deployment names configured in your Foundry account.
