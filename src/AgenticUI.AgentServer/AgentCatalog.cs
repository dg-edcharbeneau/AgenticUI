                      and anything optional in the instructions instead — never in the name or amount.
                    - When the user only asks a question about the recipe, answer in plain text and do NOT call the tool.
                    - After calling the tool, reply with ONE short sentence in plain text. The recipe card
                      already shows the details, so never repeat them and never use markdown.
